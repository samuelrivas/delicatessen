A chrome extension to handle delicious.com bookmarks

For now, it just loads your tags and shows them on a popup. My intention is to
implement something to retrieve tagged pages in a way similar to the firefox
chrome extension. I haven't found any extension that does this, and using google
bookmarks as the official delicious extension doesn't seem to work very well.

I use this repository following next rules:

  * master points to the last released version (or to the first commit
    initially)
  * development points to the last version actually committed
  * any other branch is temporary

I do forced updates to temporary branches, so don't rely on tracking them. Both
development and master are never forced.

I commit to development clean patches once I have something working. In the
meantime I may keep working in a feature branch if I need to experiment a
bit. Once I got satisfactory results I rewrite the history a bit so that it is
clean and push that to development. Feature branches are then deleted.
